React on Rails app - leveraging the power of react router with a psql database. This application hits the TMDb APi and returns a veriety of JSON data such as:
  1. Most pupular movies in theatres around the world right now
  2. Search functionaloity built in allowing to query any and all movie titles and shows, most importantly it does not have to      to be spelled correctly...unlike apple music.
  3. Rails & PSQL DB and Server leverage a one to many relationship model to allow the user to have multible movies saved to      their own personal 'to watch' list 
  
  
  Future improvements will include user authentication futher styling and general functinality updates reflecting market         needs.
